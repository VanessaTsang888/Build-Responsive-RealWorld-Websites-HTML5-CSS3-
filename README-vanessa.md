# Build Responsive RealWorld Websites HTML5 CSS3

[Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

This is an online training course I had purchased from Udemy to develop and maintain my exising responsive website design and development skills and knowledge around my full time job as a Frontend Software Engineer.

## What?

Responsive website design means making our website work efficiently on every possible mobile device.

I am combining this training course with my existing knowledge of digital accessibility which is responsive web design plus the fact that any website service should work for any users who need to use the service despite if they have any website related disability or not. Also, the website in question should work on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linix), any of the major browsers such as Edge, FireFox, Safari, Google Chrome etc.

## Why?

1. W3C Accessibility Standards
2. Upskill
3. Best practices
4. Online resources.

As well as being a dedicated Frontent Software Engineer, I am currently taking this course to become a confident Responsive Web Developer who stays on top of the W3C Standards and this training courses covers some of the [W3C Accessibility Standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/)
I am passionate about since I had completed the T18 Design and The Web at the Open University, I had develop a passion for digital accessibility and usability within responsive website development. Since I became a Frontend Software Engineer my digital accessibility skills has proven to be very valueable and I am using this course to develop them even further and to keep up with the onging development within responsive web design and development.

I strongly belive in ongoing personal development is important to keep on top of the forever developing technologies within web development and software engineering in gerneral. This is why I am upskilling/studying a couple of Udemy online training courses around my full time job as a Frontend Software Engineer.

I also strongly believe in software best practice and understand some areas of best practice can change from time to time. Therefore, it is important for me to stay on top of this and one way how I'm doing this is completing certain Udemy training courses. Thankfully, I do enjoy the ongoing training courses.

Once I have completed a Udemy training course I some times use them for reference as I understand that generally speaking Udemy courses are kept up to date and this is very useful for my job as a Frontent Software Engineer. This is important as no developer or software engineer can remember everything especially now there are more and more programming languages and frameworks coming into the marker of technologies and it is our job to stay on top of as many of them as possible. Of course, there is also Google, Stack Overflow, MDN Docs, YouTube etc we should be using since most are open source and we love to be resourcefull online to create best solutions to problems to complete our tasks efficiently.
