# L18 Installing aAdditional VS Code Extensions:

Three others to make our life easier when we code HTML and CSS.

1 - Image Previous - displays small image in gutter. Can be extremely helpful sometimes.
2 - Color Hightlight - helpfull when visualising colors in CSS.
3 - Auto Rename Tag - when I change the opening tag, it will auto change the closing one for me. Will this work for React? I will try this out when I get to my React personal development.

Go to Settings and enable the Auto Closing Tag. I've check and found that I've already done this. So when I write the opening <p> HTML is auto write the closing tag for me.

4 - Live Server: I have already download this from a previous course/project. I have the 'Go Live' button on bottom-right. It will open new tab which will contain my web page. It will auto reload my web page in the UI when I make a change to my code and save it.
On save, page will get auto updated. To stop the connection, click the Port: 5500 icon at the bottom. The port is the first couple of digits on the url. I have my own web server on my own computer running. The port is the address of my web server or the local host server.
