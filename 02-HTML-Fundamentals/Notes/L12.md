L12: Text Elements:

Working with text, how to markup text?

Headings:
To break up big blocks of text into more logical sections, add a title to each of the sections. There are 6 different headings so we can establish a hierarchy in our text so we can go from
h1 to h6 -> hierarchy of headings.
Example:

<h1>The Code Magazine</h1>
<h2>The Basic Language of the Wb: HTML</h2>
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>

Italic bold:
Use <strong></strong> to make text bold from HTML5 not <b></b>

Make text italic:
Make the word fundamentals italic:
use the <em></em> element for emphasize NOT the <i></i>

Challenge:
Make the first letter of 'HyperText Markup Language' bold.
I used the <strong></strong> element to do that.
