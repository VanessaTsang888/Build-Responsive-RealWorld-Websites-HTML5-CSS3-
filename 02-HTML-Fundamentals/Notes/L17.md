L17: A Note on Semantic HTML:

Before HTML5 most people used <div> most of the time. Now with HTML5, we write semantic HTML -> elements that have meaning / purpose to them.

These elements also has meaning and purpose to help search engines index our content.
<strong>make text bold</strong>
<em>emphasis text</em>

<div> is just  container.
Elements and container elements have meaning, i.e. <nav></nav> contain element is used to group a bunch of navigation links which is important for browsers to understand what the elements are, important for SEO and accessibility - especially for people with screen readers to consue on web pages.
Using elements may not change anything on the UI but need to understand what these elements means and what they stand for.
Summary:
1 -> for broswers to understand our elements/web pages;
2 - for SEO / optimiseation;
3 - for accessibility, i.e. people with screen readers.
