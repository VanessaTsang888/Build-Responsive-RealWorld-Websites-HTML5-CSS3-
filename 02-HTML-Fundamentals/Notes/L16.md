L16: Structuring Our Page:

For Semantic HTML:
To markup/describe our content.
Time to add some structure to our document and to our elements using the new HTML5 elements. Helps search engines index our content.
At the moment our elements are not grouped together in any logical way. So we need container elements to group our current elements together:

Links -> use page navigation: <nav></nav> element. I've used this nav container element to group all 4 links under the h1 element. In the UI nothing has changed which is what I expect. This element serves as a container (as per the body element) but elements is not containers.
Group the h1 and navigation links inside of a Header element as the rest of the content is the Blog itself: <header></header> for the top part of our page.

<header>
    <nav>
        <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>
        <a href="challenges.html">Challenges</a>
        <a href="flexbox.html">Flexbox</a>
        <a href="css-grid.html">CSS Grid</a>
    </nav>
</header>

For the rest of the content and its elements which is the blog post itslef we can use the <article></article> container element which is very common.
Now our body element only have 2 direct child elements, the <header> and the <article>.

Now do some grouping inside of the <article></article> element.
Inside of <article></article> we can use the <header> element to group the h2, image, paragraph and post img together.

The footer:

<footer> for the copyright text.
