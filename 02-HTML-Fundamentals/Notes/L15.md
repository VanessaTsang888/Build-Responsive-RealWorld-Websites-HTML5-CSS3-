L15: Hyperlinks or anchor links:

Allows the internet to be world wide web. Links between pages.
Links that point to other pages within our own website:
Links that point to other websites/pages outside of our website: use the target attribute. This will allow users to open it in new tab whilst the original one is still open. External links.
Example:

<p>
You can learn more at the
<a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
        target="_blank"
        >MDN Web Docs
</a>.
</p>

The link is a continuation of the paragraph.

What makes the anchor element a link is the href property. If we don't want it to point to anywhere then we specify a hash symbol - a placeholder link.

Link to an internal page:
Pages that is part of our Blog site. An internal link to take users to the Blog pag (blog.html) from the Home page (index.html).

<a href="blog.html">Blog</a>

A link that don't go anywhere as we don't have the page yet. The hash is like a placeholder:
<a href="#">Challenges</a>
