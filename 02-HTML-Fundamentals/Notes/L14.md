L14: Images and Attributes:

Currently my blog post is missing images using the HTML image element.
the alt (alternative text) attribute - some text to describe what the image is about.
This allows browsers to know what is in the image and index it appropriately and display on the UI.

Digital Accessibility Standards:
By specifying the description of the image we can also allow blind people to use our website or user who use a screen reader will not see our images but their screen reader will read the alternative text to them. Therefore important to write a good description.

We write the source attribute (a piece of data to describe the source which the browser should read from) to add the image file name.
The alt (alternative text) attribuet is to describe what the image is about to allow search engines to know what is in the image, and this allows blind people to use our website as their screen reader that will read this alt text to them. So never skip this attribute.

<img src="post-img" alt="HTML syntax on a computer screen" width="500" height="200" />

Challenge:
To include the luara joines image below the h2 element, 50px for the width and height.

We can use attributes to specify character sets that go in to our document, i.e. the meta data. Use all the simple characters in the English language: <meta charset="UTF-8" />
