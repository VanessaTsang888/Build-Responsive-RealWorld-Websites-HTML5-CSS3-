# Styling Text

Learn six properties to style text with css.

## A CSS Rule

A declaration block with one or more declarations. Each declaration has a property name and a value we specify for that property.

Each property can take different types of values such as length or keywords.

### Fonts:

You can't just use a font that we have installed in our machine unless our users have that font installed on their machine as well.
There is a solution for this but for now we use any font size that is a san serif.

With text-transform, we can turn text to all uppercase (most common), capitalize etc.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 26px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Style our h2 element which is the main heading of the article.

```css
h2 {
  font-size: 40px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

h3: since we have multiple h3 elements we can **style them all** using the below declaration block.

```css
h3 {
  font-size: 30px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

We can align text and the values for that including: _center_ which will centre the h4 to its _parent_ element which is the entire page in our case.

```css
h4 {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**Inheritance** (a mechanism): since we not specify the styles for the anchor, strong text and the em element, they get the styles from the p element.

```css
p {
  font-size: 22px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

Style the li elements: override the font size of 22px from the p element to 20px for this li elements.

```css
li {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```
