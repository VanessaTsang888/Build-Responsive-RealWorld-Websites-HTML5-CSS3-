# CSS Theory: Conlicts Between Selectors

What happens when we have multiple css rules that apply to same element? This is conflicting selectors.

There are multiple selectors selecting the same element. Which one of them applies?

```html
<p id="author-text" class="author">
  Posted by Laura Jones on Monday, June 21st 2027.
</p>
```

```css
.author {
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: 18px;
}

#author-text {
  font-size: 20px;
}

p,
li {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #444444;
  font-size: 22px;
}
```

All styles apply but there are conflicting font-size declaration! is it 18px or 20px or 22px?

## Resolving Conflicting Declarations

These are the most important rules.

Highest priority to Lowest priority: 5. Declarations marked !important -> a hack for last resort only. 4. Inline styles have top priority but we shouldn't be using inline styles anyway. 3. ID (#) seleector (the latest one) 4. Class (.) or pseudo-class (:) selector 5. Element selector (p, div, li, etc) 6. Universal selector (\*)

The important keywork make a declaration more important than the other ones. Instead of using this hack we should write simplier selectors. Dont add too many id's or classes all in the same element.
