# CSS Theory 2: Inheritance and the Universal Selector

We've already saw inheritance in action before. The strong element inside of the p element (post text below the author image) still gets the styles of the paragraph element (its parent element) inside of which it is located. This mean inheritance is a mechanism by which some styles or some properties get their values inherited from parent elements to child elements.

Set styles for the body element as this is the parent element for all of our other elements. So the child elements for body will get these styles that are inside the body selector. It mostly styles about text that will get inherited. The inherited styles are easily overwritten whenever there is any rule that apply for the same property.

```css
body {
  ...;
}
```

## How inheritance works

Two of the styles from the h1 element do override the inherited styles that is in the body element.

### The Universal Selector

Use this to add styles to all elements on the page and no inherintance involved. This selector has the lowest priority so very easy to override this. Use this when we want to apply a certain property that does not automatically get inherited to all the elements. On the other hand, any styles we put in the body gets inherited.

```css
* {
  ...;
}
```
