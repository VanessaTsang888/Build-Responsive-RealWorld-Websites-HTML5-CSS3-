45. Section Intro:

Up until this point we used css to add visual styles ad spacing to elements. However, css is used mainly to build layouts. We now learn to use css
to build layouts using floats and also using two really modern technologies called Flexbox and CSS Grids. 

46. The 3 Ways of Building Layouts:
Arranging elements in to some kind of structure.

There are 2 types of layouts: Page Layout vs. Component Layout.
1) Page layout is what we've been learning - laying out element or conent inside of a website.
2) On the other hand, some elements are made up of components and these need some kind of layout too as they are made up of smaller pieces of content that need
to be arranged in some kind of way. So components themseleves also have a layout.

Float Layouts:
The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the flat css property. Still used, but getting outdated fast.

Flexbox:
Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts.

CSS Grid:
Another modern way for laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimentsional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.

47. Using Floats:
I've already learnt this in the past. Will come back to this for a refresher at the end.
