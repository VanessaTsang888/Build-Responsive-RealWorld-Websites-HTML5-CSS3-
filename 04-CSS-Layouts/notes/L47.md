# Using Floats

Layouts with floats of using the display property, so we need to understand how the floats property works. When an element is floated it is removed from the normal flow: out of flow. So it is same as absolute positioning.

Continue to work on the blog page on The Code Magazine - using floats.

1. In stead of making the <p> element inline or inline-block element and the image display of reliative, we use floats.
2. This means we need to give both the <p> element and the <img /> a class so we can style those elements in the style.css file.

```html
<img src="" alt="" height="" width="" class="author-img" />
/>

<p id="" class="author">Some text here..</p>
```

Make the elements around the author image float around it.

```css
.author-img {
  float: left;
}

.author {
}
```

## The Collapsing element

Both the child of the header which is the <h1> and the <nav> both are floated which make this collapsing element -> the elements height has collapsed.

### Absolute Positioning Vs. Floats

We can compare floats with absolute positioning. So we can achieve a flating element by using float left or float right.

When an element is floated it is removed from the normal flow: out of flow. So it is same as absolute positioning.

Text and linline elements will wrap around th floated elements.

The container will not adjust its height to the element (We can say: the container element collapsed its height).
