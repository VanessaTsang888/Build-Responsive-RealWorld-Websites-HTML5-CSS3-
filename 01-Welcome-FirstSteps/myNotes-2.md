L5 - Setting Up Our Code Editor:

Blocker: when I try to edit my Settings within my VSCode, I get this error msg:
-> Unable to write into user settings. Please open the user settings to correct errors/warnings in it and try again.

VSCode: Files: Auto Save -> onFocusChange -> error msg: Unable to write into user settings. Please open the user settings to correct errors/warnings in it and try again.

I've tried this html code as someone on the same course has suggested but its not working and I still can't fix it.

"[html]": {
"editor.defaultFormatter": "vscode.html-language-features"
}

I've tried fixing the settings.json file but no luck. Used this tool/website to validate the json code inside of the file and it worked.:

L5: Setting Up Our Code Editor:
I've already intalled VSCode, and the Prettier - code formater which is format my code on save and will be easier for me to find errors in my code.
I've installed One Monokai Theme. Also, set my icon theme to Seti.

L6: your Very First Webpage!:
My first line of code/ first webpage: index.html
-> Create a project folder and create the inde.html file and write some code in it: 02-HTML-Fundamentals -> index.html file.
-> open file in browser: doble click on the file and it will open in a web browser.
-> arrange the web browser so its on the right and the VSCode is on the left that way we can see other on one single screen.
-> the 'title' of my webpage is on the web browser tab - top and above the url.
-> my code is reflected in the real world as I can see in my Chrome browser. Always use Google Chrome to test my code that I'm writing.

L7: Downloading Course Material:
Done this already from Jonas Github: Jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course
I'm using the starter files that contains images. I downloaded the files/code using the big green Code button.

L8: Watch Fevore You Start!
Eight considerations on how to take this course:
Code with the instructor. Take Notes on syntax, on theory concepts, and more - find my own style in doing this -> use my One Note app and VSCode = xxx.md file in each section. Before moving on to next section, come up with my own examples, and write code on my own - without following the instructor.
If I can't solved error by myself then use the Q&A section on each lecture as may be someone else has had same issue before. If not, create a new question.
Don't just past code in there but use a service called codepen.io
