## More information hyperlink:

Not enough whitespace between this link and the paragraph text above it. Therefore, I had to inspect the UI and tried the writing the following:

`display: block;`

`margin-top: 1rem` and it worked.

To make this change perm I had used this style in the CSS file and it worked as expected.

## Image
I've changed the source to use the same source as the lecture as this works as expected.

### classes Vs. id's
In this project we always use classes and never id's as this is future proof our code. However, according to the W3C standards should make use of id's when neccessary.

#### Bugs
I don't know why I can't get my button to style as per the final design which is text align left. However, for now it looks ok and in next lecture on this project I may be able to fix this bug.
