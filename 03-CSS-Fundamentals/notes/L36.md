# Adding Dimensions

Adding dimensions in css using the width and height properties.

## Re-size the aside element

Change the aside to be 500px wide so specify the width to 500px in css.
Define the height to 80px.

## Resize post image:

In the html > image element > write a class and name it: post-img.
In the css. It is best practice to define image size in css rather than html uing percentages rather than pixels. That is the % of the parent container which in my case is the header. Now when tesing in the UI, the image will always stay at 100% as that is always the size of the parent container. Responsive web design > websites that adapted to the screen width.
