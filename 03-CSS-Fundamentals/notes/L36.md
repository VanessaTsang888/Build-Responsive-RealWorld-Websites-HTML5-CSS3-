# Adding Dimensions

How to centre a page from inside of a browser? Use this simple trick.

1. Put all our elements into a container element. Then centre that.
2. We need a container that needs a certain width.

3. In index.html file > after the body element > write a div element (don't need to be semantic html) here. Close the div right after the footer element.

4. Inside of the open div, write a class of: container and style this in css.

5. Property of width and value of 700px.

6. Centre the container element inside of browser: add margin to left and right of container. Margin left and right set to auto so they can be automatically set by the browser. Now as we resize the broswer the margin on left and right keep growing and give us illusion that page is completely centred as the container is centred. Change to 800px for the width.
