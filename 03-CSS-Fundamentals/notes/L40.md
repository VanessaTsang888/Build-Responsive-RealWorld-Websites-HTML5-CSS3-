# CSS Theory 5 - Absolute Positioning

In CSS there are a couple of positioning modes.
**_Normal Flow Vs. Absolute Positioning:_**

We set an element to absolute positioning so we can move it anywhere on a page as it is out of flow - looses any impact on surrounding elements, may even overlap them.

| NORMAL FLOW                                                            | ABSOLUTE POSITIONING                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default positioning.                                                   | Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow".                                            |
| Element is "in flow".                                                  | No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them.                                             |
| Element are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code. | We use top, bottom, left, or right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container. |
| Default positioning -> position: relative;                             | Out of flow positioning: position: absolute;                                                       |

## Use in practice

Create a Like Button that is positioned outside of our container. Not matter of the screen size, this button will always stay in the same position, not impacted by, or impacting on the surrounded elements. It may overlap other elements depending on the screen size. This is a great example of an Absolute Positioned Element. Write the mark-up for this button at the end of the body and container elements. To create an Emoji, hold down these keys: Mac: Ctrl + Cmd + space bar or on Windows its: Windows + a period. I've installed the Emoji Snippets Extension on my Code IDE as Windows + a period is not working for me.

By default, this element is positioned in relation to the view port, the visible part of the page. We want to position this element in relation to some other parent element. To do this we set that parent element to relative which is the body element.

Don't abuse this Absolute Positioning and use it to built complex layouts. Instead we use Absolute Positioning to position single elements like this button or other small things.
