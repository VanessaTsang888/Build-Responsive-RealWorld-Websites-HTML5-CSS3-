# Lecutre 22 Intro to CSS

## What is CSS?

- It is one of the core technologies of the web.
- Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- We Use to describe the visual styles and the presentation/layout of our content written in HTML.

## What are the common terminologies from the different pieces of the css code.

CSS consists of countless properties that devs use to format the content such as properties about font, text, spacing, layout etc.

### CSS code or syntax

This is a typical small piece of CSS syntax.

- Always start with an "Selector" in this case its "h1" as we need to select it in css to apply some styles to it and layout the content.
- Each styles is called a "Declaration". Example:

```css
font-size: 20px;
```

- All the styles make up a Declaration block.
- Everything together, the Selector and the Declaration block is called a "CSS Rule".

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```
