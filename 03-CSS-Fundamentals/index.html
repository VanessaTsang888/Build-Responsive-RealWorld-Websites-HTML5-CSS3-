        <!-- The image element is a self closing tags with attributs to describe elements as we don't specify any content, i.e. 
    the source attribute or src then specify the image -->
        <!-- using the src attribute inside of the img tag (as we don't have content in img tags) to describe the element  -->
        <!-- the alt (alternative text) attribute - some text to describe what the image is about.
      This allows Chrome to know what is in the image. 
      
      By specifying the description of the image we can also allow blind people to use
    our website or user who use a screen reader will not see our images but their screen reader will read the alternative text to them.
  Therefore important to write a good description. Another use case of the alt text is if our image can't be found due to a typo in the image name
then the alt text will be displayed instead.   -->

        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
        language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
        of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <!-- ol stands for ordered list. li stands for list item - the child element of the ordered list or ol. -->
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
      <!-- Link to external website. To open the url in a new tab we use the target attribute.
      This will allow users to open it in new tab whilst the original one is still open. -->
      <p>
        You can learn more at the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN Web Docs</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <!-- ul is unordered list. The order of the list don't matter so use bullet points instead of numbers 
still need to use the li element to wrap each individual items -->
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
